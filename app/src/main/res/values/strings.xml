    <string name="sp_text">Each item in this task has a drawing of a flat piece of metal, like the example shown here.</string>
    <string name="sp_text1">Below each drawing are five objects, only one of which can be made by folding the flat piece of metal along the dotted lines. You are to select
        which object shows just how the piece of flat metal would look when it is folded at the dotted lines. When it is folded, no piece of metal overlaps any other piece,
        or is enclosed inside the object.</string>
    <string name="sp_practice">Now look at the example.\n\nSelect which of the five objects would be made by folding the flat piece along each of the dotted lines.

    <string name="sp_next">Press the object and then the NEXT button when you are ready to go on.</string>
    <string name="sp_explain">It follows the same pattern as the other figures in the box. The figure in the bottom left is larger than the one above it but otherwise the
        same. In the top row, the figure at the right is the same as the one to the left of it except that it has been turned upside down. Following these rules,
        the missing figure should be larger than the one above it, and exactly the same size as the one to the left of it, but upside down. Therefore, the response choice
        selected is the correct answer.</string>
    <string name="sp_right">That is correct.  Of the five objects shown, only this one could be made from the flat piece by folding it at each of the dotted lines.\n\n
		Press the NEXT button to continue, or the BACK button to go back one page.

    <string name="sp_wrong">No, the correct response is this one.  Only it could be made from the flat piece by folding it at each of the dotted lines.\n\n

    <string name="sp_intro">INSTRUCTIONS\n\n
		&#8226; For each item, select the object that could be made by folding the flat piece at each of the dotted lines.\n
		&#8226; All folds are indicated by dotted lines.\n
		&#8226; The solid lines show the cuts in the piece.\n
		&#8226; Parts are not folded inside of other parts of any objects (in other words, there is no overlapping).\n\n
		When you are ready, press the BEGIN button.

    <string name="pv_ex2">What is the arrow pointing to? Press the RECORD ANSWER button and say the name of the object.</string>
    <string name="pv_explain">In the above example, you would say "eraser". While the picture shows a pencil, the arrow is pointing to a specific part of this pencil
        &#8211; its eraser. Not all pictures will have arrows. In those cases, you are to say the word that best describes the entire picture. So in the above example,
        if no arrow were present, you would simply say "pencil".\n\n
		You will now be asked to identify six more pictures. Take your time. While you do not have an unlimited amount of time to respond to each problem, it is more
        important to answer correctly than to answer quickly.\n\n

		Each item in this task consists of a set of figures arranged in a pattern, formed according to certain rules. Look at the following patterns in example.
	</string>
    <string name="ar_text1">The question mark in the lower right corner of the box shows where a figure is missing in the pattern. You are to decide which of the five
        figures under the pattern belongs where the question mark is.\n\n
        Please click \"Next\" to continue.</string>

    <string name="ar_text3">In the case of the example above, the figure in the bottom left is larger than the one above it but otherwise
        same. In the top row, the figure at the right is the same as the one to the left of it except that it has been turned upside down. Following these rules,
        the missing figure should be larger than the one above it, and exactly the same size as the one to the left of it, but upside down. Therefore, the choice
        selected is the correct answer.\n\n
        Please click \"Next\" to continue.
	</string>

    <string name="practice">PRACTICE EXAMPLE</string>
    <string name="practiceq1">Here is a practice item.  Select the figure that completes the pattern then press \"Next\". </string>
    <string name="ar_instr1">In each problem, you are to decide what figure belongs where the question mark is in the pattern. To do this you have to figure out what
        the rule is according to which the drawings change, going from row to row, and what the rule is for the changes going from column to column. The items have
        different kinds of patterns and different rules by which the drawings change.\n\nPlease click Next to continue.</string>

    <string name="practiceq2">Now look at another problem, which is quite different from either of the previous ones.\n\n
    Choose the answer that belongs in \"?\" below, then click Next to continue.</string>
    <string name="pr_wrong">Going from left to right, the circles get larger, and going from top to bottom they get darker.
        Therefore
        the answer has to be a circle which is the largest of the three sizes, and the darkest. Choices 3 and 5 are both the right size, but 5 is the only large circle
        with the correct shading. Thus 5 is the only drawing that fits in the pattern formed by the other circles. 5 is the answer that should be chosen.\n\n
        Please click \"Next\" to continue.
	</string>
    <string name="pr_explain">What is the missing figure here? If you study the pattern you will see that going from left to right there is one more line in each figure
        than in the one to the left of it. Going from top to bottom, the number of lines in any figure is one less than in the figure just above it. Therefore, the
        missing figure should have three lines. The answer is choice 3 (the three lines, slanting in the proper direction).\n\n
        Please click \"Next\" to continue.</string>
    <string name="ar_intro">INSTRUCTIONS\n\n
		&#8226; You will now be asked six more questions like the ones you just did. \n
		&#8226; For each problem, decide what rules the pattern follows. Choose the answer that belongs in \"?\" by clicking the answer below it.\n
		&#8226; Many of the patterns are based on rules that are different from the ones in the sample items.  \n
