    <!-- Abstract reasoning -->
    <string name="ar_section_title">Abstract Reasoning</string>
    <string name="ar_text">INSTRUCTIONS\n\nEach item in this task consists of a set of figures arranged in a pattern formed according to certain rules. Look at the pattern in the example.
	</string>
    <string name="ar_text1">The question mark (?) in the lower right corner of the box shows where a figure is missing in the pattern. Choose which of the five
        figures (A, B, C, D or E) under the pattern belongs where the \"?\" is.\n\nThen press \"Next\" to continue.</string>

    <string name="ar_text3">In the case of the example, the correct answer is E. Going from left to
        right, the figures are the same size, but the figure on the right has been turned upside down.
        Going from top to bottom, the figures get larger in size. Following these rules, the figure
        that goes at the \"?\" should be larger than the one above it, and exactly the same
        size as the one to the left of it, but upside down. Therefore, E is the correct answer.\n\nPlease press \"Next\" to continue.
	</string>

    <string name="ar_instr1">In each question, you are to decide what figure belongs where the \"?\" is in the pattern. To do this you have
        to figure out how the figures change going from row to row, and how the figures change going from column to column.
        The items have different kinds of patterns and different rules by which the figures change.\n\nPlease press \"Next\" to continue.</string>

    <string name="start_task">Would you like to see another example, or are you ready to start this task?</string>
    <string name="example">Another example</string>
    <string name="start_task_confirm">Start task</string>

    <string name="pr_wrong">Here is another example. Going from left to right, the circles get larger, and going from top to bottom they get darker.
        Therefore the answer has to be a circle which is the largest of the three sizes, and the darkest. Choices C and E are both the right size, but E is the only
       large circle with the correct shading. Thus E is the only figure that fits in the pattern formed by the other circles. E is the answer that should be chosen.\n\nPlease press \"Next\" to continue.
	</string>

    <string name="practiceq2">Now look at another example, which is quite different from either of the previous ones.\n\nChoose the figure that belongs at the \"?\" below, then press \"Next\" to continue.</string>
    <string name="pr_explain">If you study the pattern you will see that going from left to right there is one more line in each figure
        than in the one to the left of it. Going from top to bottom, the number of lines in any figure is one less than in the figure just above it. Therefore, the
        missing figure should have three lines. The correct answer is choice C (the three lines, slanting in the proper direction).\n\nPlease press \"Next\" to continue.</string>
    <string name="ar_intro">INSTRUCTIONS\n\n
        <li>You will now be asked six more questions like the ones you just did.</li>\n
        <li> <pre>For each question, decide what rules the pattern follows. Choose the answer that belongs at the \"?\" by

    <!-- Abstract reasoning -->

    <!-- 2D visualization -->
    <string name="sp_1_instr">INSTRUCTIONS\n\nLook at the figures below. The figure at the left is shaped like the letter L. The rest of the figures are like it, except
        that they have been turned (rotated) in different directions. </string>
    <string name="sp_next">Please press \"Next\" to continue.</string>
    <string name="sp_1_sol"> If you think of the figure at the left above as being made out of wire and lying on a table, the positions shown in each of the other four
        figures could be made simply by turning (rotating) the wire figure at the left around, without lifting it off the table. \n\nPlease press \"Next\" to continue.</string>
    <string name="sp_2_instr">Now look at the next row of figures. The first figure is shaped like the letter P. But for  the rest of the figures, even if they were turned (rotated), they would still be backwards; you would have to lift the figure at the left off the table and flip it over to make any of the
        other figures. </string>
    <string name="sp_3_instr">In this task each question has one figure at the left and five similar figures to the right of it. Only one of the five
        figures on the right exactly matches the figure at the left if you turn (rotate) it. The rest of the figures are backwards even when they are turned (rotated).\n\nNow look at the sample question below.\nChoose the one figure, which, when turned (rotated), exactly matches the figure at the left.</string>
    <string name="sp_3_sol">You should have picked the fourth answer choice. All of the other choices have been \"lifted off the table and flipped over\"
        as well as turned (rotated), and thus are backwards. </string>
    <string name="sp_begin">For each question in this task, choose the one figure, which, when turned (rotated), exactly matches the figure at the left.\n\nIf you are ready to begin, please press \"Next.\"</string>
