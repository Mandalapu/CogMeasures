# CogMeasures
All the cognitive measures needed for the project Talent. This version consists the updated error timing messages.
Imported the activity and layout files for the sections SP and Switching.
Need to resolve the path errors in those activities.
Testing those two new sets individually and seeing their flow will help in changing them accoding to the new requirements.
Please download the new images from the Dropbox folders.

1) Images for AR and SP need to be changed.
2) Test SW and SP sets individually.
3) Insert appropriate error message timing for the SP, NS and SW measures. Same as the one in AR.
4) Include examples for each section similar to Specs.
5) Seeing if all the fields in JSON are getting generated properly.
6) Re-assure if the images displayed in the activities are the ones which are in the dropbox for the sections AR and SP.
